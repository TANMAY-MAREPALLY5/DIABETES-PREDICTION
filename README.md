# DIABETES-PREDICTION
Project Overview 
The Diabetes Prediction System employs several machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making early diagnoses and improving patient outcomes. 

Technology Stack
  Machine Learning Algorithms: SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest 
  Programming Language: Python 
  Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn 
  Features Model Training: Trained multiple machine learning models on the training dataset. 
  Performance Evaluation: Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
  Best Model Selection: Selected Random Forest as the best model for diabetes prediction.
